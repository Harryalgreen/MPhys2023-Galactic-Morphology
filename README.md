# MPhys2023-Galactic-Morphology
Project continuation data for (CAS Gini M20) morphological analysis of galaxies

- May 2023

This project was undertaken evaluating the morphollogy of the ISM of VIPER-generated simulated late-type spiral galaxies (g1536-MUGS, g1536-MaGICC) & (g15178-MUGS, g15178-MaGICC) (Stinson 2010, 2013) and the FIRE-2 galaxies m12i m12f (Wetzel 2016, Hopkins 2018). These files are provided in an attempt to allow others to get started on similar projects faster.

When my colleague, Kieran, and I began our morphology project, we spent a few dozen weeks basically trying to reinvent the wheel. Plenty of papers are out there on galactic morphology, but none with open-source codes on which to build. Soemtimes, project continuation 'open-source-ness' is resisted. Some may argue that because they were immiserated, others therefore deserve to be made to feel the same by the same process _and material_. However, this is against the progress-oriented attitude of science: standing on the shoulders of those before you does not free you from the existential misery of a dissertation, but it does mean you're at least making *new* progress whilst you cry.

Bon voyage, amigo!
